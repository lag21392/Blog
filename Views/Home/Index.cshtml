        <p><b>The .NET platform</b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            .NET is a developer platform made up of tools,
            programming languages, and libraries for building many different types of
            applications.
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            The base platform provides components that
            apply to all different types of apps. Additional frameworks, such as ASP.NET,
            extend .NET with components for building specific types of apps.
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            Here are some things included in the .NET
            platform:
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •The C# programming language and
            its compilers
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •Base libraries for working with
            strings, dates, files/IO, and more
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •Editors and tools for Windows,
            Linux, macOS, and Docker
        </p>

        <p><b>ASP.NET extends .NET</b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            ASP.NET extends the .NET platform with tools
            and libraries specifically for building web apps.  
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            These are some things that ASP.NET adds to the
            .NET platform:
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •Base framework for processing
            web requests
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •Web-page templating syntax,
            known as Razor, for building dynamic web pages using C#
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •Libraries for common web
            patterns, such as Model View Controller (MVC)
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •Authentication system that
            includes libraries, a database, and template pages for handling logins,
            including multi-factor authentication and external authentication with Google,
            Twitter, and more.
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •Editor extensions to provide
            syntax highlighting, code completion, and other functionality specifically for
            developing web pages
        </p>

        <p><b>Backend code in C#</b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •When using ASP.NET your back end
            code, such as business logic and data access, is written using C#.
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •Because ASP.NET extends .NET,
            you can use the large ecosystem of packages and libraries available to all .NET
            developers. You can also author your own libraries that are shared between any
            applications written on the .NET platform.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                Dynamic pages using C#, HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript
            </b>
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •Razor provides a syntax for
            creating dynamic web pages using HTML and C#. Your C# code is evaluated on the
            server and the resulting HTML content is sent to the user.
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            •Code that executes client-side
            is written in JavaScript. ASP.NET integrates with JavaScript frameworks and
            includes pre-configured templates for single page app (SPA) frameworks like
            React and Angular.
        </p>

        <p><b>Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker</b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            ASP.NET apps can be developed and run on
            Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker.
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            The Visual Studio family of products has tools
            for building .NET apps on any operating system. There are also command line
            tools and extensions for many popular editors.
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b>What is Docker?</b></p>
        <img src="~/images/docker.png" class="img-thumbnail">
        <p class=MsoNormal>Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.</p>
        <p class=MsoNormal>And importantly, Docker is open source. This means that anyone can contribute to Docker and extend it to meet their own needs if they need additional features that aren't available out of the box.</p>
